## Overview

CatchHub is a clone project that I built for practice purposes when I was new to front-end development. The goal was to recreate a static website layout for desktop screens, focusing on structuring the UI with HTML and CSS. This project is not responsive and is one of the first projects I developed to enhance my skills in web design.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5: Used for page structure and layout.
- CSS3: Used for styling the page elements, including fonts and layout design.
- Google Fonts (Source Sans Pro): Applied custom fonts for a modern look.
- Flexbox: For creating a flexible and structured page layout.

**Note: This project is only designed for desktop screens and is not responsive.**

### What I learned

- This was one of the first projects I built, and it helped me understand the basics of HTML and CSS.
- I learned to use CSS Flexbox for layout control.
- This project was a great introduction to handling web page styling, but also taught me the importance of responsive design.

### Continued development

Looking forward, I plan to:

- Make the website responsive, so it works across all devices.
- Introduce JavaScript for interactivity and improved user experience.
- Refactor the code to follow best practices I have learned since building this project.
